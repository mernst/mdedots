// Put the following in each node's .stignore file:
// #include .stglobalignore
// or, just symlink the .stignore file to this one.
// syncthing never synchronizes a file named .stignore .
// (The master version of this file is in a Git repository.)


// Incomplete Downloads
// At least for now, these prevent Syncthing from transferring data that's
// going to be thrown out anyway once the download is finished and the
// file is renamed. Things may change when Syncthing gets smarter.
