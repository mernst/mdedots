Subject: Jikes bug: incompatible types print identically in "N$P is not compatible with N$P"

[This appears to be the same as already-submitted bug #505;
I submitted it as a comment to that.]

This file, N.java:
  class N {
    void foo() {
      P p = new N$P();
    }

    public class P
    {
    }
  }
produces this output when compiled with jikes 1.14:
  % jikes -g +E +F N.java
  N.java:3:9:3:21: Error: The type of the left-hand side in this assignment, "N$P", is not compatible with the type of the right-hand side expression, "N$P".
  N.java:3:17:3:17: Error: Type N$P was not found.
The error message, "N$P is not compatible with N$P", is confusing, since
the two allegedly incompatible types print identically.  The error message
should be made clearer.
