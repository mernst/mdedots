Subject: Jikes patch: website CVS instructions

http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/cvs/os-cvs.php?group_id=10
has a few errors in its instructions.

1. It states that the CVS login command is

  cvs login :pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/jikes password:anoncvs
but in fact the correct command is

  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/jikes login

and then the user should reply "anoncvs" (without the quotes) to the
"password:" prompt.  So two things need to change in the instructions:
 * change the command as above
 * make it clear that "password:anoncvs" is not part of the command

2. It states "Check out the module: cvs checkout module name".  Here,
   "module name" should be replaced by "jikes".  Also, it is not necessary
   (for me, at least) to set the CVSROOT variable; you can just type
     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/jikes checkout jikes
   and then omit the "-d" argument thereafter (nor ever set the variable).

3. The comment "Use the -d option to specify the working directory ( if not
   the current directory)." is not true for CVS 1.10 or 1.11 (1.11 is the
   current version); -d specifies the root, not the working directory.
