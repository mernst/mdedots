Subject: Reposition-window (centering Lisp definitions)

I'd like to use this, but cd you make certain changes?

* All variables and functions in the package should have names
starting with a common prefix (or at least containing a common word).
This helps avoid name conflicts.

I don't mind if your package has two or three alternative common words,
if they make sense.

This applies even to traditional Lisp primitives which are not primitives
in Emacs Lisp--even `cadr'!  Believe it or not, there is more than one
plausible way to define `cadr'.  Play it safe; append your name prefix
to get a name like `foo-cadr' or `mylib-cadr' instead.

* Internal subroutines should have comments rather than docstrings, in
order to save space when the package is loaded.  Only people reading
the source code will want to see this text anyway.

* Each doc string's first line should be one or two complete sentences
which stand on their own as a summary.  This means starting with a
capital letter and end with a period.

A doc string can have additional lines which expand on the details of
how to use the function or variable.  The additional lines should be
made up of complete sentences also, but they may be filled if that
looks good.

* When a doc string refers to a Lisp symbol, write it as it would be
printed (which usually means in lower case), with single-quotes around
it.  For example: `lambda'.  There are two exceptions: write t and nil
without single-quotes.

* When a doc string refers to the value of an argument of the current
function, use a word in all caps.  Thus, DIVISOR is how the / function
doc string refers to its second argument.  Also use all caps for meta-
syntactic variables when you show the decomposition of a list or
vector into components, some of which may be variable.
