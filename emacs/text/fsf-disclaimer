Here's what you should send to each other contributor.  I need
papers from each person who contributed more than about ten lines
(counting both comments and code).

======================================================================
I'd like to ask you to sign a disclaimer for your changes,
thus putting them in the public domain.  (For small to medium changes
such as this, that is just as good for us as assigning copyright.)
I'm assuming that you wrote these changes yourself;
if other people wrote parts, we may need papers from them.

    I, <name of person>, hereby disclaim all copyright interest in my
    changes and enhancements to "pp.el" (the "Program").

    I affirm that I have no other intellectual property interest that
    would undermine this release, or the use of the Program, and will
    do nothing to undermine it in the future.  I represent that the
    changes and enhancements are my own and not a copy of someone
    else's work.

    <signature and date>

*Don't forget to include the date.*

If you are employed to do programming (even at a university), or have
made an agreement with your employer or school saying it owns programs
you write, then we also need a signed disclaimer from your employer
or school.

This disclaimer should be signed by a vice president or general manager
of the company.  If you can't get at them, it is almost as good to
find someone who signs licenses for software that is purchased.  Here
is a sample wording:

  Digital Stimulation Corporation hereby disclaims all copyright
  interest in the changes and enhancements made by Hugh Heffner to the
  program "seduce" (the "Program").

  Digital Stimulation Corporation affirms that it has no other
  intellectual property interest that would undermine this release, or
  the use of the Program, and will do nothing to undermine it in the
  future.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1987
  Ty Coon, President of Vice, Digital Stimulation Corp.

If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim that
could conflict with the use of the program, then please put me in
touch with a suitable representative of the company, so that we can
negotiate what to do about it.

IMPORTANT: When you talk to your employer, *no matter what
instructions they have given you*, don't fail to show them the sample
disclaimer above, or a disclaimer with the details filled in for your
specific case.  Companies are usually willing to sign a disclaimer
without any fuss.  If you make your request less specific, you may
open Pandora's box and cause a long and unnecessary delay.

Please snail the signed disclaimers to:
