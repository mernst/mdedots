To answer the question "How do I find the documentation for a
function which c-h f prints out?" first type c-h k c-h f to find out
what c-h f runs, you get:

describe-function:
Display the full documentation of FUNCTION (a symbol).

That means that the code:
	(describe-function 'some-function)
will produce this info.  It pops up the help window just like c-h f
(since it's what c-h f calls).  You could test this by typing:
	m-ESC (describe-function 'describe-function)
which produces the same output as above.

If what you wanted was just to pop up a standard help window, that's
all you need, but I'm assuming you want to get the string.  So now use
tags on the emacs source (that's what the source is for :-) First load
the tags table (note, the file name may differ on your system
depending on where emacs is installed) by typing:
	m-x visit-tag /src/site/emacs/src/

Then we use those tags to find the actual function. Type:
	m-. describe-function

If m-. doesn't find the exact match you want (say, you got
electric-describe-function), then c-u m-. (or m-0 m-. if you have a real
META key) will find the next matching function.

Anyway, we see that the main work is done by calling the function
documentation.  Let's get help on that:
	c-h f documentation

documentation:
Return the documentation string of FUNCTION.

This seems to be what you want, just for completeness let's look at source
for this:
	m-. documentation

Oh, wow!  We made it into the C code...  This code isn't too hard to
guess at, but now you know what you wanted and a little bit more (and
you wouldn't have had to wait the time it takes for a message to go
out and a reply to come back :-).

So for example, the code:
	(documentation 'describe-function)
will return the documentation for the function called by c-h f and now
we have come full circle.
