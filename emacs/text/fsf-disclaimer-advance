Subject: Re: Emacs disclaimers and assignments

Here's a disclaimer-in-advance that Microsoft could sign.  There is a
lot of flexibility in how to describe the category of works it applies
to.  Any description that covers the work you want to contribute would
suffice.  And if it fails to cover all of the work, it might still be
useful (though we would have to check, when you send a change, that it
is covered).


		   EMPLOYER DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS

     We agree that software and other authored works of the 'Released
  Category' (defined below), made by our employee/consultant,
  _______________________, prior to the date of this document, and for
  _____ years thereafter, are freely assignable by said
  employee/consultant to Free Software Foundation (FSF) for distribution
  and sharing under its free software policies.  We disclaim any status
  as the author or owner of such works.

     The Released Category comprises changes and enhancements to the
  program GNU Emacs.  The Released Category excludes
  ______________________ [if 'none', please so state; thank you--FSF].

     We affirm that we will do nothing in the future to undermine this
  release.  If we have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface
  copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the
  works, or the GNU Emacs program to which these works constitute
  changes and enhancements, or use of those programs, then the Free
  Software Foundation and the general public will be permanently and
  irrevocably licensed to use, in these works and in the programs they
  enhance, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the
  dominating interest.

     We make no warranty as to the quality of the material or as to the
  presence of absence of rights therein of any other party, and we do
  not purport to disclaim, release or grant any rights other than our
  own.

     Given as a sealed instrument this ___ day of ______, 1994.
