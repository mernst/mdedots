  ASSIGNMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN REVISIONS OF GNU Emacs


  For $1 and other good and valuable consideration received from 
  Free Software Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation of the 
  state of Massachusetts, hereinafter "FSF", the undersigned 
  "Developer" does hereby agree as follows:

  1.(a) Developer hereby agrees to assign and does hereby assign to FSF
  Developer's copyright in changes and/or enhancements to the program
  GNU Emacs (herein called the Program).  These changes and/or
  enhancements are herein called the Works.

  (b) The assignment of par. 1(a) above applies to all past and future
  works of Developer, written before 1 August 1999, that constitute
  changes and enhancements to the Program.

  (c) For the purposes of this contract, a work "based on the Works"
  means any work that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived
  from all or part of the Works.

  (d) The assignment of par. 1(a) includes works "based on the Works"
  written by Developer.

  (e) FSF agrees to grant back to Developer, and does hereby grant,
  non-exclusive, royalty-free and non-cancellable rights to use the
  Works (i.e., Developer's changes and/or enhancements, not the Program
  that they enhance), as Developer sees fit; this grant back does not
  limit FSF's rights and public rights acquired through this agreement.

  (f) FSF has all the rights of a copyright owner in the assigned
  copyrights, subject to the license grantback to developer stated
  above, including the right to enforce the copyright in aid of the free
  software purposes of this agreement, and the right to use, license and
  distribute the works, or works based on the works, with the program
  enhanced thereby or as stand-alone modules, all as made or acquired by
  developer or in modified form.  FSF may charge a fee of its choosing
  for the service of distribution.

  2. Developer will report occasionally, on its initiative and whenever
  requested by FSF, the changes and/or enhancements he makes, and (to
  the extent known to Developer) any outstanding rights, or claims of
  rights, of any person, that might be adverse to the rights of
  Developer or FSF or to the purpose of this contract.

  3.(a) The parties shall execute such documents and undertake such acts
  as may be requested by the other to implement the letter and spirit of
  this agreement and any conveyance stated herein, subject to a
  limitation of reasonableness of such request with attention to cost
  and time burdens imposed thereby.

  (b) The undertakings in par. 3(a), above, are without prejudice to the
  conveyances made through this assignment document.  The intention of
  FSF and Developer is that this assignment document will be
  supplemented rarely, if at all, by other documents.

  4. FSF agrees that all distribution of the Works, or of any work
  "based on the Works", or the Program as enhanced by the Works, that
  takes place under the control of FSF or its agents or successors,
  shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone
  possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing
  accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of the work to
  anyone on the same terms.  These terms shall not restrict which
  members of the public copies may be distributed to.  These terms shall
  not require a member of the public to pay any royalty to FSF or to
  anyone else for any permitted use of the work they apply to, or to
  communicate with FSF or its agents or assignees in any way either when
  redistribution is performed or on any other occasion.

  5. FSF agrees that any program "based on the Works" offered to the
  public by FSF or its agents or assignees shall be offered in the form
  of machine-readable source code, in addition to any other forms of
  FSF's choosing.  However, FSF is free to choose at its convenience the
  media of distribution for machine-readable source code and may charge
  a fee of its choosing for copies.

  6. Developer hereby agrees that if he has or acquires hereafter any
  patent or interface copyright or other intellectual property interest
  dominating the Works, the Program, the Program as enhanced by the
  Works, or other enhancements to the Program, or the use of any of
  those, such dominating interest will not be used to undermine the
  effect of this assignment, i.e. the Foundation and the general public
  will be licensed to use, in that program or programs and their
  derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of
  the dominating interest.  This license provision will be binding on
  the assignees of, or other successors to, the dominating interest, as
  well as on Developer.  This license grant is nonexclusive,
  royalty-free and non-cancellable.

  7. (a) Developer warrants to FSF that his reports in accord with
  section 2 above are accurate and that he is the sole copyright holder
  of the Works.

  (b) Developer agrees to hold FSF harmless from damage arising out of any
  breach of this warranty---any adverse ownership interest not reported
  by Developer and resulting in direct or indirect harm to FSF.
  Developer's warranty and hold harmless obligation does not run to the
  general public except insofar as damage to the public results in harm
  to FSF.

  (c) Developer is not obliged to defend FSF against any spurious claim of
  adverse ownership, but will cooperate with FSF in defending against
  any such claim and in any event be responsible if the claim is not
  spurious, i.e. if the adverse claimant is a true owner and FSF is
  thereby damaged.

  (d) Developer makes no other express or implied warranty (including
  without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

  8. This agreement and all conveyances made pursuant hereto are deemed
  made in Massachusetts, this agreement and all such conveyances being
  deemed made under seal, as of the date of fixation of any work covered
  hereby in tangible form and, also, as of the date of execution of this
  agreement by Developer.
